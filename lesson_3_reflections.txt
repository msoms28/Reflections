When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If I am collaborating online with coworkers or friends it is better to use a
    remote repository so everyone can see your changes.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You can decide when to pull changes instead of Git automatically pulling which
    could prevent conflicts within the code if someone else has updated the remote.
    It provides more control over what version of the repository you have.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are basically clones within GitHub.  Clones are a copy of the repo made
    locally to your machine.  Branches are any sort of split off of the master set
    of commits.  You would branch off of a master head in your local repository.
    You would clone a repository from GitHub to your local device.  You would
    fork off of an existing repo in GitHub.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    The benefit is to have the latest version offline so you reduce the chances
    of introducing merge errors into the repo.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I would probably use email or a wiki/sharepoint solution in order to communicate
    and update files.  This would make it much harder to make sure everything that
    is different is merged together into the final state of the repo.  However
    it is easier than learning a lot of this Git proprietary info!

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
